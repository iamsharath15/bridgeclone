                    Everyone in this world is talented and blessed with a <span>unique gift.</span> But many of them are not able to get a good job or create their dream company because there is a gap between<span> what they know </span>and <span>what is needed in the industry.</span> This program is aimed at bridging that gap so that everyone irrespective of their background,culture, educational status, gender, or age can learn the basics of programming and the fundamentals of business so that they can go ahead and get a good job or start their own company.

<h4>We (Suresh and George) have created a unique <span class="new">people-first culture</span> at MacAppStudio and hire without resumes or interviews because we have a stringent training process. Even though we sincerely wish to take all those who come in, unfortunately we cannot give the training or jobs to all because of the constraints we have on the office space and our projects.</h4>
<h4>So we have decided to publish the same <span>world class training program</span> we give to our team, online also, so that anyone from any corner of Tamilnadu can learn the concepts, start programming, and fine-tune their skills to get a great job or start their own company.</h4>
<h4>So instead of giving a fish (Job), we are trying to<span> teach how to fish</span> so that you can go ahead to get your fish (Job) anytime.</h4>
